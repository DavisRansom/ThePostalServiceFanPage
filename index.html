    <h2>History of the Band</h2>
    <p>
      No one knew that the eccletic mix of pop-folk singer, Ben Gibbard, and electronic musician Jimmy Tamborello would ever work. Why would it? They were literally snailmailing their incomplete songs back and forth to each other, when each would add his part and send it back for more revisions. The results, however, were what has come to be considered a masterpiece of electronic pop music.
    </p>
    <p>The only real album that they ever prdouced, <i>Give Up</i>, has become a best-selling cult classic. The album's blend of Gibbard's syrupy sweet pop melodies and Tamborello's intricate, spot-on electronic sounds are, at various points, both poignant and blissful. 
    <p><i>Give Up</i> was released in 2003 by SubPop Records</p>
